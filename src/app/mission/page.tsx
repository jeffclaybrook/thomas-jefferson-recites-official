      Re-launching The Declaration of Independence onto the National Stage

    <h3 className="mb-8">
      A Script by Craig L. Claybrook, a.k.a. Thomas Jefferson
    </h3>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
     Ladies and Gentlemen, this message is entitled “Re-launching <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> onto the National Stage.” This title may seem a little strange until we look at a its historical background. Whenever and wherever it was originally introduced, it became a phenomenon and people were fascinated. Over the decades, it was a common practice for the <em>Declaration</em> to be read in the public arena and on Fourth of July. At some point in the Twentieth Century, things changed. Interest waned to the point that it was no longer read in public and was scarcely mentioned in public. For all practical purposes, it “vanished.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      INTRODUCTION: So, the document needs to be “re-launched” for four reasons:
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      <strong>The First Reason addresses the Significance and Impact of the Document.</strong> According to church historians, “<em>The Declaration of Independence</em> is one of the two most significant documents in human history, second only to the Bible!” Its impact is that, not only did it end the tyranny of the King of England, but it demolished a grueling 2,000 years of tyranny in Western Civilization!
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      The other half of “one of the two most significant documents” happens to be <em>The Constitution of the United States</em>. It introduced the most formidable system of governance known to man, a “Constitutional Republic.” John Adams called it governing “by laws, and not of men,” and “not the whims of men.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      Its impact is that it has been operational for almost two-and-a-half centuries in America. In Europe, every country that watched the Revolutionary War from “afar” eventually became a Constitutional Republic. So, did all fifty of our state governments. Historians have paid tribute to these two documents by declaring them: “the pinnacle of human history since the time of Christ!”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      CONCLUSION: In short, one document ended twenty centuries of tyranny. The other is a governing masterpiece.

    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      <strong>The Second Reason addresses America’s Foundational Underpinnings of the Document.</strong> Secular historians tell us that “the pathway to the <em>Declaration</em> began when the British attacked Lexington, Massachusetts at dawn on April 19, 1775.” However, church historians tell us that the pathway began 700 years before that and it consisted of three pivotal events. Vastly intertwined with these events was the Roman Catholic Church.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In 1075, Pope Gregory VII instituted sweeping reforms across Western Europe in which he admonished the kings and rulers “to stay out of the church’s business.” This eventually became known as “separation of church and state” in its original form and it also marked the beginning of “freedom of religion.” Seven centuries later, the Founders would turn the Pope’s “freedom of religion” into a rallying cry throughout the colonies.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In 1215, Cardinal Stephen Langton introduced his 3500-word document, the <em>Magna Carta</em>. It dealt with “limiting the power of kings,” the overriding issue of the Middle Ages. It was later designated as England’s foremost legal document, still in effect to this very day. The Founders relied on this document as their primary source for rebutting the king’s edicts and atrocities.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In 1517, a certain priest and Bible scholar was aghast with abuses he observed in the Roman Church. His name was Martin Luther. This provoked him to tack his ninety-five theses onto the Wittenburg door. As a result, Pope Leo X responded by putting Luther on trial for heresy, under penalty of death by burning at the stake. At his trial, Luther argued that it was “wrong for anyone to act against his conscience in religious matters.” This became known as “liberty of conscience” and this phrase sparked what became known as the Protestant Reformation. What Luther started has lasted for more than 500 years!
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      Luther also stirred up a Political Reformation by establishing his “Resistance Theory.” This document advocated “disobeying corrupt magistrates and their unjust laws.” The Founders drew heavily from Luther and his two Reformations.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      CONCLUSION: These three events serve as the “highlight” of America’s Foundational Underpinnings and its “pathway to the <em>Declaration</em>.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      TRANSITION: Ladies and Gentlemen, I don’t know if you noticed or not but the <em>Declaration</em> contains four references to God. These four references are found in the first two sentences and last two sentences, effectively forming bookends around the <em>Declaration</em>. This was the Founders’ way of “shouting from the rooftops” that God is “in” <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> and God is “in” the founding of this country.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8 text-center">
      <em>The Laws and Nature and of Nature’s God</em>
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      <strong>The Third Reason addresses the “Genius” of the Document.</strong> The first reference is entitled, “The Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God.” When I was asked to write the <em>Declaration</em>, I faced a severe issue that needed attention. The King of England had ordered the writing of laws that portrayed the Founders and colonists as outlaws and criminals. As a result, I needed a way to “legitimize” American independence to four audiences. These include the king and his minions, our fellow colonists, the watching world, and all future generations. I needed a law that not only preceded the king’s laws but superseded the king’s laws.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In writing the first sentence, my thoughts turned to Sir Edward Coke, a Catholic theologian and scholar. (His name was pronounced Cook but spelled C o k e). In college at age fifteen, I had been introduced to Coke’s “law of nature” through his writings, dating back to 1611. He described this law as being “infused into the heart of the creature at the time of his creation.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      Even before Moses introduced the Ten Commandments, the Jews were said to have had this law “written with the finger of God in the heart of man.” The Apostle Paul also wrote about this law in Romans Chapter Two: “While the gentiles who do not have the law do naturally the things of the law….” And interestingly, the Roman Catholic Church added this “law of nature” to their Canon Law in the 1300s.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      CONCLUSION: So, what happened? The “Law of Nature and of Nature’s God” profoundly “legitimized” American independence.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8 text-center">
      <em>All Men are Created Equal and Endowed by their Creator with Certain Unalienable Rights</em>
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      The second reference reads, “all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.” Here we see the two pillars of governance: laws and rights. “All men are created equal” addresses the laws of nature, while “unalienable rights” refer to inborn rights. Under English Common Law, “unalienable rights” are possessions that “could not be denied, taken away, or transferred to others.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      So, what does the phrase “all men are created equal” mean? It means three things: 1) it means that we are all created in the image of God, 2) it means that we were all created in a state of perfect innocence, and 3) it means that, having never sinned, we will never be closer to God in this life … than when we were in our mother’s womb!
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      However, we were also created equal in other ways. Because of Adam and Eve’s fall from grace in the garden, everyone born after that was born with a “sin nature.” If any of you have ever sinned, then you have a “sin nature.” And, according to Luther, this automatically implies that we were all born with a need for a Redeemer to forgive our sins. Luther called this his “Creator/Redeemer Distinction.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8 text-center">
      <em>The Supreme Judge of the World</em>
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In the third reference to God, the Founders appealed “to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions.” This had to do with God’s “omniscience” or “all-knowing ways.” We wanted our audiences, both present and future, to know that our motives were pure.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8 text-center">
      <em>The Protection of Divine Providence</em>
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      In the fourth reference, the Founders implored “the protection of Divine Providence.” This refers to the “Sovereignty of God,” a theological term for the “supreme authority of God.” “Sovereignty” is an attribute while Divine Providence” is a title. We Founders appealed to Divine Providence because our lives were in grave danger.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      CONCLUSION: So, there you have it: the “genius” of the document centers on these four references. Historians tell us: “Without these four references, the <em>Declaration</em> would have been an empty shell of a document.” We’re getting pretty close to the end.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      <strong>The Fourth Reason addresses the “Downfall” of the Document.</strong> The “downfall” of the <em>Declaration</em> closely parallels the advancement of atheism in our country and, oddly enough, it all started in a court of law. This advancement began when the U.S. Supreme Court of 1947 reversed Pope Gregory VII’s 1075 A.D. meaning of “separation of church and state.” Almost a thousand years later, it went from “keeping the state out of the church’s business” to “keeping the church out of the state’s business.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      This took place at the bidding of an atheist organization via their amicus brief in a court case called <em>Everson v. Board of Education</em>. It did so, supposedly, in order to “secularize” America but it should have been labeled “de-Christianize” America. After the Court ruled in favor of <em>Everson</em>, this case remained idle until 1962 when the Court used “judicial precedent” to take prayer out of public schools. Then, in 1963, it ruled to take Bible reading out of public schools. Over several decades, more than a dozen court cases had been decided by “keeping the church out of the state’s business.” All of these cases were “rooted” in atheism.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      EPILOGUE: Some of you may be wondering, “What’s wrong with atheism?” In this instance, it denigrates 700 years of America’s Foundational Underpinnings, 160 years of legal precedent, and 7.5 years of “blood, sweat, and tears” of those who gave us our freedom.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      Furthermore, it desecrates <em>The Declaration of Independence</em> and <em>The Constitution of the United States</em> by degrading their tributes as: “The two most significant documents in human history, second only to the Bible,” and as “the pinnacle of Western Civilization since the time of Christ.” That is what is wrong with atheism in America, plus it reduced Christian citizens to “second class citizenship.”
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 leading-8">
      <em>In conclusion, because God’s hand is on it, it’s time to re-launch the Declaration onto the national stage! Won’t you join me!</em>
